I'm feeling like I'm famous the talk of the town They say I've gone mad Yeah I've gone mad But they don't know what I know 'Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back Yeah they're talking back oh Pre-Chorus At night when the stars light up my room I sit by myself    Talking to the moon Tryna get to you In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?    Do you ever hear me calling? Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon    Still trying to get to you In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?    Oh-oh I know you're somewhere out there Somewhere far away    Taking it slow saving up she Before she knows it all I ask before she goes home She's tired of crying and sick of his lies She's suffered him for far too many years of her life Feeling low and scared that he'll say Do you know how over time you drove her away? Saving up for the day when she goes The day that she stands up for everything that she chose    She can say she can say She can say she can say She can say she can say Who knows what she's gonna say?

to care a little less When I Google I only get depressed I was taught to dodge those issues I was told Don't worry there's no doubt There's always something to cry about When you're stuck in angry crowd They don't think what they say Before they open their mouth  Chorus Eliza Doolittle & Lloyd Wade You gotta Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag And bury them beneath the sea I don't care what the people may say What the people may say about me Pack up your troubles get your old kit bag Don't worry about the cavalry I don't care what the whisperers say Cause they whisper too loud for me  Verse  Eliza Doolittle Hot topic Maybe I should drop it It's a touchy subject And I like to tiptoe 'round The ship going down We got no penny no pound So if your business is running out It's not my business to talk about They don't think what to say Before they open their mouth Chorus Eliza Doolittle & Lloyd Wade You gotta Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag And bury them beneath the

Luke and Max Martin    You think I'm pretty without any makeup on You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong I know you get me so I let my walls come down down Before you met me I was

Tell me how's your family? I haven't seen them in a while You've been good busier than ever We small talk work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why  Pre-Chorus Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses and I left them there to die    So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time    These days I haven't been sleeping Staying up playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didn't call And I think about summer all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side and Realized I loved you in the fall Pre-Chorus And then the cold came The dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye    So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time    I miss your tan skin your sweet smile So good to me so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it but I can't So if the chain is on your door I understand    But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December turn around and make it alright I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time All the time    You were in college working part-time waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts  Pre-Chorus  I say Can you believe it? As we're lying on the couch The moment I could see it Yes yes I can see it now    Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine    Flash forward and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  Pre-Chorus  But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes yes This is what I thought about   Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine    And I remember that fight  AM As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said I'll never leave you alone  Chorus  You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine Hold on make it last Hold on never turn back You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine   Yeah yeah Do you believe it?

Does he bear himself like a pauper? No Louis XIV could be no more insolent in his assurance His eyes say plainly Female halt! His posture exults Ah female I am the eternal male the giver of life Behold in my hot flesh all the delights of this world Salute me I am strength All this with a languid posture there is no mistaking his meaning  A Negro girl strolls past the corner lounger Her whole body panging* * from pang and posing A slight shoulder movement that calls attention to her bust that is all of a dare A hippy undulation below the waist that is a sheaf of promises tied with conscious power She is acting out I'm a darned sweet woman and you know it These little plays by strolling players are acted out daily in a dozen streets in a thousand cities and no one ever mistakes the meaning  Will to Adorn  The will to adorn is the second most notable characteristic in Negro expression Perhaps his idea of ornament does not attempt to meet conventional standards but it satisfies the soul of its creator In this respect the American Negro has done wonders to the English language It has often been stated by etymologists that the Negro has introduced no African words to the language This is true but it is equally true that he has made over a great part of the tongue to his liking and has had his revision accepted by the ruling class No one listening to a Southern white man talk could deny this Not only has he softened and toned down strongly consonanted words like aren't  to ain't  and the like he has made new force words out of old feeble elements Examples of this are ham-shanked battle-hammed double-teen bodaciously muffle-jawed  But the Negro's greatest contribution to the language is   the use of metaphor and simile;  the use of the double descriptive;  the use of verbal nouns   Metaphor and Simile  One at a time like lawyers going to heaven You sho is propaganda Sobbing hearted I'll beat you till a rope like okra b slack like lime c smell like onions Fatal for naked Kyting along That's a rope Cloakers--deceivers Regular as pig-tracks Mule blood--black molasses That's a lynch Syndicating--gossiping Flambeaux--cheap cafe lighted by flambeaux To put yo'self on de ladder   The Double Descriptive  High-tall Little-tee-ninchy tiny Low-down Top-superior Sham-polish Lady-people Kill-dead Hot-boiling Chop-axe Sitting-chairs De watch wall Speedy-hurry More great and more better  Verbal Nouns  She features somebody I know Funeralize Sense me into it Puts the shamery on him 'Taint everybody you kin confidence I wouldn't friend with her Jooking--playing piano or guitar as it is done in Jook-houses houses of ill-fame Uglying away I wouldn't scorn my name all up on you Bookooing beaucoup around--showing off Won't stand a broke She won't take a listen He won't stand straightening That is such a compliment That's a lynch  The stark trimmed phrases of the Occident seem too bare for the voluptuous child of the sun hence the adornment It arises out of the same impulse as the wearing of jewelry and the making of sculpture--the urge to adorn  On the walls of the homes of the average Negro one always finds a glut of gaudy calendars wall pockets and advertising lithographs The sophisticated white man or Negro would tolerate none of these even if they bore a likeness to the Mona Lisa No commercial art for decoration Nor the calendar nor the advertisement spoils the picture for this lowly man He sees the beauty in spite of the declaration of the Portland Cement Works or the butcher's announcement I saw in Mobile a room in which there was an over-stuffed mohair living-room suite an imitation mahogany bed and chifferobe a console victrola The walls were gaily papered with Sunday supplements of the Mobile Register There were seven calendars and three wall pockets One of them was decorated with a lace doily The mantel-shelf was covered with a scarf of deep home-made lace looped up with a huge bow of pink crepe paper Over the door was a huge lithograph showing the Treaty of Versailles being signed with a Waterman fountain pen  It was grotesque yes But it indicated the desire for beauty And decorating a decoration as in the case of the doily on the gaudy wall pocket did not seem out of place to the hostess The feeling back of such an act is that there can never be enough of beauty let alone too much Perhaps she is right We each have our standards of art and thus are we all interested parties and so unfit to pass judgment upon the art concepts of others  Whatever the Negro does of his own volition he embellishes His religious service is for the greater part excellent prose poetry Both prayers and sermons are tooled and polished until they are true works of art The supplication is forgotten in the frenzy of creation The prayer of the white man is considered humorous in its bleakness The beauty of the Old Testament does not exceed that of a Negro prayer Angularity  After adornment the next most striking manifestation of the Negro is Angularity Everything that he touches becomes angular In all African sculpture and doctrine of any sort we find the same thing  Anyone watching Negro dancers will be struck by the same phenomenon Every posture is another angle Pleasing yes But an effect achieved by the very means which an European strives to avoid  The pictures on the walls are hung at deep angles Furniture is always set at an angle I have instances of a piece of furniture in the middle of a wall being set with one end nearer the wall than the other to avoid the simple straight line  Assymetry  Asymmetry is a definite feature of Negro art I have no samples of true Negro painting unless we count the African shields but the sculpture and carvings are full of this beauty and lack of symmetry  It is present in the literature both prose and verse I offer an example of this quality in verse from Langston Hughes  I ain't gonna mistreat ma good gal any more I'm just gonna kill her next time she makes me sore  I treats her kind but she don't do me right She fights and quarrels most ever' night  I can't have no woman's got such low-down ways Cause de blue gum woman ain't de style now'days  I brought her from the South and she's goin on back Else I'll use her head for a carpet tack  It is the lack of symmetry which makes Negro dancing so difficult for white dancers to learn The abrupt and unexpected changes The frequent change of key and time are evidences of this quality in music Note the St Louis Blues  The dancing of the justly famous Bo-Jangles and Snake Hips are excellent examples  The presence of rhythm and lack of symmetry are paradoxical but there they are Both are present to a marked degree There is always rhythm but it is the rhythm of segments Each unit has a rhythm of its own but when the whole is assembled it is lacking in symmetry But easily workable to a Negro who is accustomed to the break in going from one part to another so that he adjusts himself to the new tempo  Dancing  Negro dancing is dynamic suggestion No matter how violent it may appear to the beholder every posture gives the impression that the dancer will do much more For example the performer flexes one knee sharply assumes a ferocious face mask thrusts the upper part of the body forward with clenched fists elbows taut as in hard running or grasping a thrusting blade That is all But the spectator himself adds the picture of ferocious assault hears the drums and finds himself keeping time with the music and tensing himself for the struggle It is compelling insinuation That is the very reason the spectator is held so rapt He is participating in the performance himself--carrying out the suggestions of the performer  The difference in the two arts is  the white dancer attempts to express fully; the Negro is restrained but succeeds in gripping the beholder by forcing him to finish the action the performer suggests Since no art ever can express all the variations conceivable the Negro must be considered the greater artist his dancing is realistic suggestion and that is about all a great artist can do  Negro Folklore  Negro folklore is not a thing of the past It is still in the making Its great variety shows the adaptability of the black man nothing is too old or too new domestic or foreign high or low for his use God and the Devil are paired and are treated no more reverently than Rockefeller and Ford Both of these men are prominent in folklore Ford being particularly strong and they talk and act like gooduadnatured stevedores or mill-hands Ole Massa is sometimes a smart man and often a fool The autouadmobile is ranged alongside of the oxcart The angels and the apostles walk and talk like section hands And through it all walks Jack the greatest culture hero of the South; Jack beats them all--even the Devil who is often smarter than God  Culture Heroes  The Devil is next after Jack as a culture hero He can out-smart everyone but Jack God is absolutely no match for him He is good-natured and full of humour The sort of person one may count on to help out in any difficulty  Peter the Apostle is the third in importance One need not look far for the explanation The Negro is not a Christian really The primitive gods are not deities of too subtle inner reflection ; they are harduadworking bodies who serve their devotees Just as laboriously as the suppliant serves them Gods of physical violence stopping at nothing to serve their followers Now of all the apostles Peter is the most active When the other ten fell back trembling in the garden Peter wielded the blade on the posse Peter first and foremost in all action The gods of no peoples have been philosophic until the people themselves have approached that state  The rabbit the bear the lion the buzzard the fox are culture heroes from the animal world The rabbit is far in the lead of all the others and is blood brother to Jack In short the trickster-hero of West Africa has been transplanted to America  John Henry is a culture hero in song but no more so than Stacker Lee Smokey Joe or Bad Lazarus There are many many Negroes who have never heard of any of the song heroes but none who do not know John Jack and the rabbit  Examples of Folklore and the Modern Culture Hero  Why de Porpoise's Tail is on Crosswise  Now I want to tell you 'bout de porpoise God had done made de world and everything He set de moon and de stars in de sky He got de fishes of de sea and de fowls of de air completed  He made de sun and hung it up Then He made a nice gold track for it to run on Then He said Now Sun I got everything made but Time That's up to you I want you to start out and go round de world on dis track just as fast as you kin make it And de time it takes you to go and come I'm going to call day and night De Sun went zoomin' on cross de elements Now de porpoise was hanging round there and heard God what he tole de Sun so he decided he'd take dat trip round de world hisself He looked up and saw de Sun kytin' along so he lit out too him and dat Sun!  So de porpoise beat de Sun round de world by one hour and three minutes So God said Aw naw this ain't gointer do! I didn't mean for no thin' to be faster than de Sun! So God run dat porpoise for three days before he run him down and caught him and took his tail off and put it on crossways to slow him up Still he's de fastest thing in de water  And dat's why de porpoise got his tail on crossways  Rockefeller and Ford  Once John D Rockefeller and Henry Ford was woofing at each other Rockefeller told Henry Ford he could build a solid gold road round the world Henry Ford told him if he would he would look at it and see if he liked it and if he did he would buy it and put one of his tin lizzies on it  Originality  It has been said so often that the Negro is lacking in originality that it has almost become a gospel Outward signs seem to bear this out But if one looks closely its falsity is immediately evident  It is obvious that to get back to original sources is much too difficultfor any group to claim very much as a certainty What we really mean by originality is the modification of ideas The most ardent admirer of the great Shakespeare cannot claim first source even for him It is his treatment of the borrowed material  So if we look at it squarely the Negro is a very original being While he lives and moves in the midst of a white civilisation everything that he touches is re-interpreted for his own use He has modified the language mode of food preparation practice of medicine and most certainly the religion of his new country just as he adapted to suit himself the Sheik hair-cut made famous by Rudolph Valentino  Everyone is familiar with the Negro's modification of the whites' musical instruments so that his interpretation has been adopted by the white man himself and then re-interpreted In so many words Paul Whiteman is giving an imitation of a Negro orchestra making use of white-invented musical instruuadments in a Negro way Thus has arisen a new art in the civilised world and thus has our so-called civilisation come The exchange and re-exchange of ideas between groups  Imitation  The Negro the world over is famous as a mimic But this in no way damages his standing as an original Mimicry is an art in itself If it is not then all art must fall by the same blow that strikes it down When sculpture painting acting dancing literature neither reflect nor suggest anything in nature or human experience we turn away with a dull wonder in our hearts at why the thing was done Moreover the contention that the Negro imitates from a feeling of inferiority is incorrect He mimics for the love of it The group of Negroes who slavishly imitate is small The average Negro glories in his ways The highly educated Negro the same The self-despisement lies in a middle class who scorns to do or be anything Negro That's just like a Nigger is the most terrible rebuke one can lay upon this kind He wears drab clothing sits through a boresome church service pretends to have no interest in the community holds beauty contests and otherwise apes all the mediocrities of the white brother The truly cultured Negro scorns him and the Negro farthest down is too busy spreading his junk in his own way to see or care He likes his own things best Even the group who are not Negroes but belong to the sixth race buy such records as Shake dat thing and Tight lak dat They really enjoy hearing a good bible-beater preach but wild horses could drag no such admission from them Their ready-made expression is  We done got away from all that now Some refuse to countenance Negro music on the grounds that it is niggerism and for that reason should be done away with Roland Hayes was thoroughly denounced for singing spirituals until he was accepted by white audiences Langston Hughes is not considered a poet by this group because he writes of the man in the ditch who is more numerous and real among us than any other  But this group aside let us say that the art of mimicry is better developed in the Negro than in other racial groups He does it as the mocking-bird does it for the love of it and not because he wishes to be like the one imitated I saw a group of small Negro boys imitating a cat defecating and the subsequent toilet of the cat It was very realistic and they enjoyed it as much as if they had been imitating a coronation ceremony The dances are full of imitations of various animals The buzzard lope walking the dog the pig's hind legs holding the mule elephant squat pigeon's wing falling off the log seabord imitation of an engine starting and the like  Absence of the Concept of Privacy  It is said that Negroes keep nothing secret that they have no reserve This ought not to seem strange when one considers that we are an outdoor people accustomed to communal life Add this to alluadpermeating drama and you have the explanation  There is no privacy in an African village Loves fights possessions are to misquote Woodrow Wilson Open disagreements openly arrived at The community is given the benefit of a good fight as well as a good wedding An audience is a necessary part of any drama We merely go with nature rather than against it  Discord is more natural than accord If we accept the doctrine of the survival of the fittest there are more fighting honors than there are honors for other achievements Humanity places premiums on all things necessary to its well-being and a valiant and good fighter is valuable in any community So why hide the light under a bushel? Moreover intimidation is a recognised part of warfare the world over and threats certainly must be listed under that head So that a great threatener must certainly be conuadsidered an aid to the fighting machine So then if a man or woman is a facile hurler of threats why should he or she not show their wares to the community? Hence the holding of all quarrels and fights in the open One relieves one's pent-up anger and at the same time earns laurels in intimidation Besides one does the community a service There is nothing so exhilarating as watching well-matched oppouadnents go into action The entire world likes action for that matter Hence prize-fighters become millionaires  Likewise love-making is a biological necessity the world over and an art among Negroes So that a man or woman who is proficient sees no reason why the fact should not be moot He swaggers She struts hippily about Songs are built on the power to charm beneath the bed-clothes Here again we have individuals striving to excel in what the community considers an art Then if all of his world is seeking a great lover why should he not speak right out loud?  It is all in a view-point Love-making and fighting in all their branches are high arts other things are arts among other groups where they brag about their proficiency just as brazenly as we do about these things that others consider matters for conversation behind closed doors At any rate the white man is despised by Negroes as a very poor fighter individually and a very poor lover One Negro speaking of white men said White folks is alright when dey gits in de bank and on de law bench but dey sho' kin lie about wimmen folks  I pressed him to explain Well you see white mens makes out they marries wimmen to look at they eyes and they know they gits em for just what us gits em for 'Nother thing white mens say they goes clear round de world and wins all de wimmen folks way from they men folks Dat's a lie too They don't win nothin they buys em Now de way I figgers it if a woman don't want me enough to be wid me 'thout I got to pay her she kin rock right on but these here white men don't know what to do wid a woman when they gits her--dat's how come they gives they wimmen so much They got to Us wimmen works jus as hard as us does an come home an sleep wid us every night They own wouldn't do it and its de mens fault Dese white men done fooled theyself bout dese wimmen  Now me I keeps me some wimmens all de time Dat's whut dey wuz put here for--us mens to use Dat's right now Miss Y'all wuz put here so us mens could have some pleasure Course I don't run round like heap uh men folks But if my ole lady go way from me and stay more'n two weeks I got to git me somebody ain't I ?  The Jook  Jook is the word for a Negro pleasure house It may mean a bawdy house It may mean the house set apart on public works where the men and women dance drink and gamble Often it is a combination of all these  In past generations the music was furnished by boxes another word for guitars One guitar was enough for a dance; to have two was considered excellent Where two were playing one man played the lead and the other seconded him The first player was picking and the second was framming that is playing chords while the lead carried the melody by dexterous finger work Sometimes a third player was added and he played a tom-tom effect on the low strings Believe it or not this is excellent dance music  Pianos soon came to take the place of the boxes and now player-pianos and victrolas are in all of the Jooks  Musically speaking the Jook is the most important place in America For in its smelly shoddy conuadfines has been born the secular music known as blues and on blues has been founded jazz The singing and playing in the true Negro style is called jooking  The songs grow by incremental repetition as they travel from mouth to mouth and from Jook to Jook for years before they reach outside ears Hence the great variety of subject-matter in each song  The Negro dances circulated over the world were also conceived inside the Jooks They too make the round of Jooks and public works before going into the outside world  In this respect it is interesting to mention the Black Bottom I have read several false accounts of its origin and name One writer claimed that it got its name from the black sticky mud on the bottom of the Mississippi river Other equally absurd statements gummed the press Now the dance really originated in the Jook section of Nashville Tennessee around Fourth Avenue This is a tough neighbourhood known as Black Bottom--hence the name  The Charleston is perhaps forty years old and was danced up and down the Atlantic seaboard from North Carolina to Key West Florida  The Negro social dance is slow and sensuous The idea in the Jook is to gain sensation and not so much exercise So that just enough foot movement is added to keep the dancers on the floor A tremendous sex stimulation is gained from this But who is trying to avoid it? The man the woman the time and the place have met Rather little intimate names are indulged in to heap fire on fire  These too have spread to all the world  The Negro theatre as built up by the Negro is based on Jook situations with women gambling fighting drinking Shows like Dixie to Broadway are only Negro in cast and could just as well have come from pre-Soviet Russia  Another interesting thing--Negro shows before being tampered with did not specialise in octoroon chorus girls The girl who could hoist a Jook song from her belly and lam it against the front door of the theatre was the lead even if she were as black as the hinges of hell The question was Can she jook? She must also have a good belly wobble and her hips must to quote a popular work song Shake like jelly all over and be so broad Lawd Lawd and be so broad So that the bleached chorus is the result of a white demand and not the Negro's  The woman in the Jook may be nappy headed and black but if she is a good lover she gets there just the same A favorite Jook song of the past has this to say  Singer  It ain't good looks dat takes you through dis world Audience  What is it good mama? Singer Elgin movements in your hips Twenty years guarantee  And it always brought down the house too  Oh de white gal rides in a Cadillac De yaller gal rides de same Black gal rides in a rusty Ford But she gits dere just de same  The sort of woman her men idealise is the type that is put forth in the theatre The art-creating Negro prefers a not too thin womanwho can shake like jelly all over as she dances and sings and that is the type he put forth on the stage She has been banished by the white producer and the Negro who takes his cue from the white  Of course a black woman is never the wife of the upper class Negro in the North This state of affairs does not obtain in the South however I have noted numerous cases where the wife was considerably darker than the husband People of some substance too  This scornful attitude towards black women receives mouth sanction by the mud-sills  Even on the works and in the Jooks the black man sings disparagingly of black women They say that she is evil That she sleeps with her fists doubled up and ready for action All over they are making a little drama of waking up a yaller wife and a black one  A man is lying beside his yaller wife and wakes her up She says to him Darling do you know what I was dreaming when you woke me up? He says No honey what was you dreaming? She says I dreamt I had done cooked you a big fine dinner and we was setting down to eat out de same plate and I was setting on yo' lap jus huggin you and kissin you and you was so sweet  Wake up a black woman and before you kin git any sense into her she be done up and lammed you over the head four or five times When you git her quiet she'll say Nigger know whut I was dreamin when you woke me up?  You say No honey what was you dreamin? She says I dreamt you shook yo' rusty fist under my nose and I split yo' head open wid a axe  But in spite of disparaging fictitious drama in real life the black girl is drawing on his account at the commissary Down in the Cypress Swamp as he swings his axe he chants  Dat ole black gal she keep on grumblin New pair shoes new pair shoes I'm goint to buy her shoes and stockings Slippers too slippers too  Then adds aside  Blacker de berry sweeter de juice  To be sure the black gal is still in power men are still cutting and shooting their way to her pillow To the queen of the Jook!  Speaking of the influence of the Jook I noted that Mae West in Sex had much more flavor of the turpentine quarters than she did of the white bawd I know that the piece she played on the piano is a very old Jook composition Honey let yo' drawers hang low had been played and sung in every Jook in the South for at least thirty-five years It has always puzzled me why she thought it likely to be played in a Canadian bawdy house  Speaking of the use of Negro material by white performers it is astonishing that so many are trying it and I have never seen one yet entirely realistic They often have all the elements of the song dance or expression but they are misplaced or distorted by the accent falling on the wrong element Every one seems to think that the Negro is easily imitated when nothing is further from the truth Without exception I wonder why the black-face comedians are black-face; it is a puzzle--good comedians but darn poor niggers Gershwin and the other Negro rhapsodists come under this same axe Just about as Negro as caviar or Ann Pennington's athletic Black Bottom When the Negroes who knew the Black Bottom in its cradle saw the Broadway version they asked each other Is you learnt dat new Black Bottom yet? Proof that it was not their dance  And God only knows what the world has suffered from the white damsels who try to sing Blues  The Negroes themselves have sinned also in this respect In spite of the goings up and down on the earth from the original Fisk Jubilee Singers down to the present there has been no genuine presentation of Negro songs to white audiences The spirituals that have been sung around the world are Negroid to be sure but so full of musicians' tricks that Negro congregations are highly entertained when they hear their old songs so changed They never use the new style songs and these are never heard unless perchance some daughter or son has been off to college and returns with one of the old songs with its face lifted so to speak  I am of the opinion that this trick style of delivery was originated by the Fisk Singers; Tuskeegee and Hampton followed suit and have helped spread this misconception of Negro spirituals This Glee Club style has gone on so long and become so fixed among concert singers that it is considered quite authentic But I say again that not one concert singer in the world is singing the songs as the Negro song-makers sing them  If anyone wishes to prove the truth of this let him step into some unfashionable Negro church and hear for himself  To those who want to institute the Negro theatre let me say it is already established It is lacking in wealth so it is not seen in the high places A creature with a white head and Negro feet struts the Metropolitan boards The real Negro theatre is in the Jooks and the cabarets Self-conscious individuals may turn away the eye and say Let us search elsewhere for our dramatic art Let 'em search They certainly won't find it Butter Beans and Susie Bo-Jangles and Snake Hips are the only performers of the real Negro school it has ever been my pleasure to behold in New York  Dialect  If we are to believe the majority of writers of Negro dialect and the burnt-cork artists Negro speech is a weird thing full of ams and Ises Fortunately we don't have to believe them We may go directly to the Negro and let him speak for himself  I know that I run the risk of being damned as an infidel for declaring that nowhere can be found the Negro who asks am it? nor yet his brother who announces Ise uh gwinter He exists only for a certain type of writers and performers  Very few Negroes educated or not use a clear clipped I It verges more or less upon Ah I think the lip form is responsible for this to a great extent By experiment the reader will find that a sharp i is very much easier with a thin taut lip than with a full soft lip Like tightening violin strings  If one listens closely one will note too that a word is slurred in one position in the sentence but clearly pronounced in another This is particularly true of the pronouns A pronoun as a subject is likely to be clearly enunciated but slurred as an object For example You better not let me ketch yuh  There is a tendency in some localities to add the h to it and pronounce it hit Probably a vestige of old English In some localities if  is ef  In story telling so is universally the connective It is used even as an introductory word at the very beginning of a story In religious expression and is used The trend in stories is to state conclusions; in religion to enumerate  I am mentioning only the most general rules in dialect because there are so many quirks that belong only to certain localities that nothing less than a volume would be adequate  Now He told me He said You got the three witnesses One is water one is spirit and one is blood And these three correspond with the three in heben--Father Son and Holy Ghost  Now I ast Him about this lyin in sin and He give me a handful of seed and He tole me to sow 'em in a bed and He tole me I want you to watch them seeds The seeds come up about in places and He said Those seeds that come up they died in the heart of the earth and quickened and come up and brought forth fruit But those seeds that didn't come up they died in the heart of the earth and rottenend  And a soul that dies and quickens through my spirit they will live forever but those that dont never pray they are lost forever Rev Jessie Jefferson \n"
