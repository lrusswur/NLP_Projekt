 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTake me to the docks, there's a ship without a name there\nAnd it is sailing to the middle of the sea\nThe water there is deeper than anything you've ever seen\nJump right in and swim until you're free\n\n[Chorus]\nI will remember your face\nCause I am still in love with that place\nBut when the stars are the only things we share\nWill you be there?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMoney came like rain to your hands while you were waiting\nFor that cold long promise to appear\nPeople in the churches started singing above their hands\nThey say, \"My God is a good God and He cares\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI will remember your face\nCause I am still in love with that place\nWhen the stars are the only things we share\nWill you be there?\n\n[Bridge]\nI've got a plan, I've got an atlas in my hands\nI'm gonna turn when I listen to the lessons I've learned\nI've got a plan, I've got an atlas in my hands\nI'm gonna turn when I listen to the lessons I've learned9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
