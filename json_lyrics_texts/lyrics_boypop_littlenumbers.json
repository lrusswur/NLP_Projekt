 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm waiting for your call and for the moon\nTo release me from the longest afternoon\nI've rearranged parts of my living room\nBut time is hard to kill since I met you\nI'm looking at the cars that drive on by\nWhile spring is making promises outside\nRed cars are quite rare, I realize\nAnd then I wonder which color you would like\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSeven little numbers, baby, they could be a start\nSeven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart and\n\n[Chorus]\nWhoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be\nWhoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat\nWhoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true\nThese numbers could be lucky for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI watch the sky change to a darker blue\nI can't think of another thing to do\nAnd every song just makes me think of you\nBecause the singer sounds as if she was longing\nAs if she was longing, too\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSeven little numbers, baby, they could be a start\nSeven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart\nAnd seven little numbers, baby, they could make a change\nSeven little numbers make a fire out of this flame\n\n[Chorus]\nWhoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be\nWhoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat\nWhoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true\nThese numbers could be lucky for you\n\n[Bridge]\nI read your name on every wall\nOn every wall, tell me\nIs there a cure for me at all?\nFor me at all, tell me\nI read your name on every wall\nOn every wall, tell me\nIs there a cure for me at all, for me at all?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be\nWhoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat\nWhoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true\nThese numbers could be lucky for you\n[Outro]\nThese numbers could be lucky for you\nThese numbers could be lucky for you12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
