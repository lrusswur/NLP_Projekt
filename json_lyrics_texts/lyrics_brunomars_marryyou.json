I think I wanna marry you\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I know this little chapel on the boulevard, we can go\nNo one will know\nOh, come on, girl\nWho cares if we're trashed? Got a pocket full of cash we can blow\nShots of patron\nAnd it's on, girl\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't say no, no, no, no, no\nJust say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd we'll go, go, go, go, go\nIf you're ready, like I'm ready\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's a beautiful night\nWe're looking for something dumb to do\nHey baby, I think I wanna marry you\nIs it the look in your eyes\nOr is it this dancing juice?\nWho cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you, oh\n[Verse 2]\nI'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing, like ooh\nSo what you wanna do?\nLet's just run, girl\nIf we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool\nNo, I won't blame you\nIt was fun, girl\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't say no, no, no, no, no\nJust say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd we'll go, go, go, go, go\nIf you're ready, like I'm ready\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's a beautiful night\nWe're looking for something dumb to do\nHey baby, I think I wanna marry you\nIs it the look in your eyes\nOr is it this dancing juice?\nWho cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you\n\n[Bridge]\nJust say, \"I do...\"\nTell me right now, baby\nTell me right now, baby, baby\nJust say, \"I do...\"\nTell me right now, baby\nTell me right now, baby, baby\n[Chorus]\nOh, it's a beautiful night\nWe're looking for something dumb to do\nHey baby, I think I wanna marry you\nIs it the look in your eyes\nOr is it this dancing juice?\nWho cares, baby?
