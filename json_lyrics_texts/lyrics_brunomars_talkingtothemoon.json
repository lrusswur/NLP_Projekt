 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI know you're somewhere out there\nSomewhere far away\nI want you back, I want you back\nMy neighbors think I'm crazy\nBut they don't understand\nYou're all I had, you're all I had\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAt night when the stars light up my room\nI sit by myself\n\n[Chorus]\nTalking to the moon\nTryna get to you\nIn hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too\nOr am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town\nThey say I've gone mad\nYeah, I've gone mad\nBut they don't know what I know\n'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back\nYeah, they're talking back, oh\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAt night when the stars light up my room\nI sit by myself\n\n[Chorus]\nTalking to the moon\nTryna get to you\nIn hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too\nOr am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?\n\n[Bridge]\nDo you ever hear me calling?\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\n'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon\n\n[Chorus]\nStill trying to get to you\nIn hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too\nOr am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?\n\n[Outro]\nOh-oh\nI know you're somewhere out there\nSomewhere far away80EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
