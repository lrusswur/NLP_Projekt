 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTaking it slow, saving up, she\nBefore she knows it, all I ask before she goes home\nShe's tired of crying and sick of his lies\nShe's suffered him for far too many years of her life\nFeeling low and scared that he'll say\nDo you know how, over time, you drove her away?\nSaving up for the day when she goes\nThe day that she stands up for everything that she chose\n\n[Chorus]\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say\n[Verse 2]\nSaving up for the day when she goes\nThe day that she stands up for everything that she chose\nTaking the kids and driving away\nTurn around the life she let him siphon away\nAnd I've been with you for all of these years\nTell you what I've got to show for all of my tears\nThe times you hurt me and treated me wrong\nSomething had to give to stop this thing from going on\n\n[Chorus]\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say\n\n[Instrumental break]\n\n[Chorus]\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nShe can say, she can say\nWho knows what she's gonna say?\nShe can say\n[Verse 3]\nShe's tired of crying and sick of his lies\nShe's suffered him for far too many years of her life\nAnd feeling low and scared that he'll say\nDo you know how, over time, you drove her away?7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
