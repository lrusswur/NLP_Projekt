 "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nI see you driving around town with the girl I love\nAnd I'm like, \"Forget you\" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nI guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough\nI'm like: \"Forget you and forget her, too\"\nSaid if I was richer\nI'd still be with ya\nHah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)\nAnd although there's pain in my chest\nI still wish you the best\nWith a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari\nBut that don't mean I can't get you there\nI guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari\nBut the way you play your game ain't fair\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI pity the fool that falls in love with you\n(Oh shh, she's a gold digger)\nWell.. (Just thought you should know)\n(Ooh) I've got some news for you\n(\"...Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend\")\n\n[Chorus]\nI see you driving around town with the girl I love\nAnd I'm like, \"Forget you\" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nI guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough\nI'm like: \"Forget you and forget her, too\"\nSaid if I was richer\nI'd still be with ya\nHah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)\nAnd although there's pain in my chest\nI still wish you the best\nWith a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)\n[Verse 2]\nNow I know, that I had to borrow\nBeg and steal and lie and cheat\nTrying to keep ya, trying to please ya\n'Cause being in love with your... ain't cheap, nah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI pity the fool, that falls in love with you\n(Oh shh, she's a gold digger)\nWell... (Just thought you should know)\n(Ooh) I've got some news for you\n(\"...Ooh, I really hate yo'... right now\")\n\n[Chorus]\nI see you driving around town with the girl I love\nAnd I'm like, \"Forget you\" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nI guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough\nI'm like: \"Forget you and forget her, too\"\nSaid if I was richer\nI'd still be with ya\nHah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)\nAnd although there's pain in my chest\nI still wish you the best\nWith a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)\n\n[Bridge]\nNow baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?\n(So bad, so bad, so bad)\nI tried to tell my momma, but she told me:\n\"This is one for your dad\"\n(Your dad, your dad, your dad)\nYes, she did, and I'm like\nUh! Why? Uh! Why? Uh! Why lady?!\nOh, I love you\nOh, I still love you, ooh\n[Chorus]\nI see you driving around town with the girl I love\n\"Forget you\" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nI guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough\nI'm like: \"forget you,\" and forget her, too\nSaid if I was richer\nI'd still be with ya\nHah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)\nAnd although there's pain in my chest\nI still wish you the best\nWith a forget you (oh, ooh, oooh)14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
