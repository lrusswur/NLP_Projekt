 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThink about it, there must be higher love\nDown in the heart and in the stars above\nWithout it, life is wasted time\nLook inside your heart, I'll look inside mine\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nThings look so bad everywhere\nIn this whole world, what's fair?\nWe walk blind and we try to see\nFalling behind in what could be\n\n[Hook]\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love\nWhere's this higher love, I've been thinking of?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWorlds are turning and we're just hanging on\nFacing our fear, standing out there alone\nOh a yearning, and it's real for me\nThere must be someone who's feeling for me\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nThings look so bad everywhere\nIn this whole world, what's fair?\nWe walk blind and we try to see\nFalling behind in what could be\n[Hook]\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love\nWhere's this higher love, I've been thinking of?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI will wait for it, I'm not too late for it\nUntil then, I'll sing my song\nTo cheer the night along\nI could light the night up with my soul on fire\nI could make the sun shine from pure desire\nLet me feel the love come over me\nLet me feel how strong it can be\n\n[Hook 2]\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love, oh\nBring me a higher love\nI could rise above for this higher love6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
