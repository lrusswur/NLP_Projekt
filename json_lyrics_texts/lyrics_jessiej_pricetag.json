 "lyrics": "[Intro: Jessie J]\nOkay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea\nYou ready?\n\n[Verse 1: Jessie J]\nSeems like everybody's got a price\nI wonder how they sleep at night\nWhen the sale comes first and the truth comes second\nJust stop for a minute and smile\nWhy is everybody so serious?\nActing so damn mysterious\nGot shades on your eyes\nAnd your heels so high that you can't even have a good time\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]\nEverybody look to their left\nEverybody look to their right\nCan you feel that? Yeah\nWe're paying with love tonight\n\n[Chorus: Jessie J]\nIt's not about the money, money, money\nWe don't need your money, money, money\nWe just wanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\nAin't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching\nAin't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n[Verse 2: Jessie J]\nOkay\nWe need to take it back in time\nWhen music made us all unite\nAnd it wasn't low blows and video hoes\nAm I the only one getting tired?\nWhy is everybody so obsessed?\nMoney can't buy us happiness\nCan we all slow down and enjoy right now?\nGuarantee we'll be feeling alright\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]\nEverybody look to their left (To their left)\nEverybody look to their right (To their right)\nCan you feel that? Yeah\nWe're paying with love tonight\n\n[Chorus: Jessie J]\nIt's not about the money, money, money\nWe don't need your money, money, money\nWe just wanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\nAin't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching\nAin't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n[Verse 3: B.o.B]\nYeah, yeah, well, keep the price tag and take the cash back\nJust give me six strings (Six strings) and a half-stack (Half stack)\nAnd you can, can keep the cars, leave me the garage\nAnd all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars\nAnd guess what? In thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars\nYeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds\nIt's like this, man, you can't put a price on a life\nWe do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night\nSo we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never\nWaiting to see this in the sign of defeat, uh-uh\nSo we gon' keep everyone moving their feet\nSo bring back the beat and then everyone sing\nIt's not about the money\n\n[Chorus: Jessie J, B.o.B]\nIt's not about the money, money, money\nWe don't need your money, money, money\nWe just wanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\nAin't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching\nAin't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag (Hey! Hey!)\nIt's not about the money, money, money (We don't need it)\nWe don't need your money, money, money (No, I don't, we don't need it)\nWe just wanna make the world dance (Dance, dance your ass off)\nForget about the price tag (Ah, ah)\nAin't about the, yea-yeah!, cha-ching, cha-ching\nAin't about the, woo!, ba-bling, ba-bling (It ain't about)\nWanna make the world dance (Yeah, yeah)\nForget about the price tag\n[Outro: Jessie J]\nAhh, ahh, ahh, ahh\nYeah, yeah, ahh, ooh-ooh, ahh\nForget about the price tag, heh33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
