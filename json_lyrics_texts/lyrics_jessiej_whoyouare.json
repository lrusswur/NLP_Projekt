 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nMmm, yeah, oh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nI stare at my reflection in the mirror\nWhy am I doing this to myself?\nLosing my mind on a tiny error\nI nearly left the real me on the shelf\nNo, no, no, no, no\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't lose who you are in the blur of the stars\nSeeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing\nIt's okay not to be okay\nSometimes it's hard to follow your heart\nTears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising\nJust be true to who you are\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWho you are, who you are, who you are\nWho you are, who you are, who you are\n(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)\nWho you are, who you are, who you are\nWho you are, who you are\n[Verse 2]\nBrushing my hair, do I look perfect?\nI forgot what to do to fit the mold, yeah\nThe more I try, the less it's working, yeah, yeah\n'Cause everything inside me screams\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't lose who you are in the blur of the stars\nSeeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing\nIt's okay not to be okay\nSometimes it's hard to follow your heart\nBut tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising\nThere's nothing wrong with who you are\n\n[Bridge]\nYes, no, egos, fake shows, like whoa\nJust go and leave me alone\nReal talk, real life, good love, goodnight\nWith a smile, that's my home\nThat's my home, no\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't lose who you are in the blur of the stars\nSeeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing\nIt's okay not to be okay\nSometimes it's hard to follow your heart\nTears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising\nJust be true to who you are\nYeah34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
