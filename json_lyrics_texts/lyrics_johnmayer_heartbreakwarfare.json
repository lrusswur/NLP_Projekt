 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLightning strike\nInside my chest to keep me up at night\nDream of ways\nTo make you understand my pain\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nClouds of sulfur in the air\nBombs are falling everywhere\nIt's heartbreak warfare\nOnce you want it to begin\nNo one really ever wins\nIn heartbreak warfare\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want more love\nWhy don't you say so?\nIf you want more love\nWhy don't you say so?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDrop his name\nPush it in and twist the knife again\nWatch my face\nAs I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain\n[Pre-Chorus]\nClouds of sulfur in the air\nBombs are falling everywhere\nIt's heartbreak warfare\nOnce you want it to begin\nNo one really ever wins\nIn heartbreak warfare\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want more love\nWhy don't you say so?\nIf you want more love\nWhy don't you say so?\nJust say so\n\n[Bridge]\nHow come the only way to know how high you get me\nIs to see how far I fall?\nGod only knows how much I'd love you if you let me\nBut I can't break through it all\nIt's a heart, heartbreak\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight\nLet's just fix this whole thing now\nI swear to God we're gonna get it right\nIf you lay your weapon down\n[Chorus]\nRed wine and Ambien\nYou're talking shit again\nIt's heartbreak warfare\nGood to know it's all a game\nDisappointment has a name\nIt's heartbreak, heartbreak\n\n[Outro]\nIt's heartbreak warfare\nIt's heartbreak warfare\nIt's heartbreak warfare13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
