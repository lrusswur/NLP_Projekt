 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou think I'm pretty without any makeup on\nYou think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong\nI know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down\nBefore you met me, I was alright\nBut things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life\nNow every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's go all the way tonight\nNo regrets, just love\nWe can dance until we die\nYou and I, we'll be young forever\n\n[Chorus]\nYou make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream\nThe way you turn me on, I can't sleep\nLet's run away and don't ever look back\nDon't ever look back\nMy heart stops when you look at me\nJust one touch, now, baby, I believe\nThis is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back\nDon't ever look back\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach\nGot a motel and built a fort out of sheets\nI finally found you, my missing puzzle piece, I'm complete\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's go all the way tonight\nNo regrets, just love\nWe can dance until we die\nYou and I, we'll be young forever\n\n[Chorus]\nYou make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream\nThe way you turn me on, I can't sleep\nLet's run away and don't ever look back\nDon't ever look back\nMy heart stops when you look at me\nJust one touch, now, baby, I believe\nThis is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back\nDon't ever look back\n\n[Bridge]\nI'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans\nBe your teenage dream tonight\nLet you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans\nBe your teenage dream tonight\n(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)\n\n[Chorus]\n(You) You make me (Make me)\nFeel like I'm livin' a teenage dream\nThe way you turn me on, I can't sleep\nLet's run away and don't ever look back\nDon't ever look back (No)\nMy heart stops when you look at me\nJust one touch, now, baby, I believe\nThis is real (Oh), so take a chance and don't ever look back\nDon't ever look back\n[Outro]\nI'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans\nBe your teenage dream tonight\nLet you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans\nBe your teenage dream tonight\n(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)32EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
