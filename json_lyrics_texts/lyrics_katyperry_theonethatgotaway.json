 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSummer after high school, when we first met\nWe'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead\nAnd on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos\nUsed to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof\nTalked about our future like we had a clue\nNever planned that one day I'd be losing you\n\n[Chorus]\nIn another life, I would be your girl\nWe'd keep all our promises, be us against the world\nIn another life, I would make you stay\nSo I don't have to say you were the one that got away\nThe one that got away\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was June, and you were my Johnny Cash\nNever one without the other, we made a pact\nSometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa\nSomeone said you had your tattoo removed\nSaw you downtown, singing the blues\nIt's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse\n\n[Chorus]\nBut in another life, I would be your girl\nWe'd keep all our promises, be us against the world\nIn another life, I would make you stay\nSo I don't have to say you were the one that got away\nThe one that got away\n[Post-Chorus]\nThe one\nThe one\nThe one\nThe one that got away\n\n[Bridge]\nAll this money can't buy me a time machine, no\nCan't replace you with a million rings, no\nI should've told you what you meant to me, whoa\n'Cause now I pay the price\n\n[Chorus]\nIn another life, I would be your girl\nWe'd keep all our promises, be us against the world\nIn another life, I would make you stay\nSo I don't have to say you were the one that got away\nThe one that got away\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nThe one (The one)\nThe one (The one)\nThe one (The one)\nIn another life, I would make you stay\nSo I don't have to say you were the one that got away\nThe one that got away46EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
