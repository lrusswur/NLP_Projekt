 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nRock Mafia\n\n[Verse 1]\nFor those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy\nHave to get my way, yep\n24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that\nEvery guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention\nLike I'm under inspection\nI always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nI go through guys like money flying out the hands\nThey try to change me, but they realize they can't\nAnd every tomorrow is a day I never plan\nIf you're gonna be my man, understand\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't be tamed, I can't be tamed\nI can't be blamed, I can't, can't\nI can't, can't be tamed\nI can't be changed, I can't be tamed\nI can't be, can't, I can't be tamed\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya\nI'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell (I'm not a brat like that)\nI'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged\nIf you can understand this, we can make some magic\nI'm wrong like that\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go\nI wanna be a part of something I don't know\nAnd if you try to hold me back, I might explode\nBaby, by now you should know\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't be tamed, I can't be tamed (I can't be tamed)\nI can't be blamed, I can't, can't\nI can't, can't be tamed\nI can't be changed, I can't be tamed\nI can't be, can't, I can't be tamed\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, I'm not a trick you play\nI'm wired a different way\nI'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA\nDon't change me, don't change me (Ooh, oh, oh)\nDon't change me, don't change me (Ooh, oh, oh)\n(I can't be tamed)\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go\nI wanna to be a part of something I don't know\nAnd if you try to hold me back, I might explode\nBaby, by now you should know\n[Chorus]\nI can't be tamed, I can't be tamed\nI can't be blamed, I can't, can't\nI can't, can't be tamed\nI can't be changed, I can't be tamed\nI can't be, can't, I can't be tamed12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
