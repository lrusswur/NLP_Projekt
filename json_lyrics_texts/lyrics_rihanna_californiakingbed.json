 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nChest to chest (Chest to chest)\nNose to nose (Nose to nose)\nPalm to palm\nWe were always just that close (Just that close)\nWrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)\nToe to toe (Toe to toe)\nLips that felt just like the inside of a rose\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo how come when I reach out my finger\nIt feels like more than distance between us?\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this California king bed\nWe're ten thousand miles apart\nI've been California wishing on these stars\nFor your heart, for me\nMy California king\n\n[Verse 2]\nEye to eye (Eye to eye)\nCheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)\nSide by side\nYou were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)\nArm in arm\nDusk to dawn\nWith the curtains drawn\nAnd a little last night on these sheets\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo how come when I reach out my fingers\nIt seems like more than distance between us?\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this California king bed\nWe're ten thousand miles apart\nI've been California wishing on these stars\nFor your heart, for me\nMy California king\n\n[Bridge]\nJust when I felt like giving up on us\nYou turned around and gave me one last touch\nThat made everything feel better\nAnd even then, my eyes got wetter\nSo confused, wanna ask you if you love me\nBut I don't wanna seem so weak\nMaybe I've been California dreaming\nHey, hey, hey, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this California king bed\nWe're ten thousand miles apart\nBeen California wishing on these stars\nFor your heart, for me\nMy California king\n[Guitar Solo]\nMy California king\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this California king bed\nWe're ten thousand miles apart\nI've been California wishing on these stars\nFor your heart, for me\nMy California king31EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
