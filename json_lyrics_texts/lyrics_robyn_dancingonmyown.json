 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSomebody said you got a new friend\nDoes she love you better than I can?\nThere's a big, black sky over my town\nI know where you at, I bet she's around\n\n[Refrain]\nYeah, I know it's stupid, I just gotta see it for myself\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh\nI'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh\nI'm giving it my all\nBut I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh\nI keep dancing on my own\n(I keep dancing on my own)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm just gonna dance all night\nI'm all messed up, I'm so outta line\nStilettos and broken bottles\nI'm spinning around in circles\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ooh\nI'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh\nI'm giving it my all\nBut I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh\nI keep dancing on my own\nI keep dancing on my own\n[Bridge]\nSo far away, but still so near\n(The lights go on, the music dies)\nBut you don't see me standing here\n(I just came to say goodbye)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh\nI'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh\nI'm giving it my all\nBut I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooh\nI keep dancing on my own\nI keep dancing on my own\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh\nI'm right over here, why can't you see me? Ooh\nI'm giving it my all\nBut I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo\nI keep dancing on my own\nI keep dancing on my own\n\n[Outro]\nI keep dancing on my own19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
