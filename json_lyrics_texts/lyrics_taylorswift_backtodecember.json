 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm so glad you made time to see me\nHow's life? Tell me, how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good, busier than ever\nWe small talk, work and the weather\nYour guard is up and I know why\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBecause the last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses, and I left them there to die\n\n[Chorus]\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese days, I haven't been sleeping\nStaying up, playing back myself leaving\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nAnd I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side and\nRealized I loved you in the fall\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd then the cold came\nThe dark days when fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\n[Bridge]\nI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\n[Chorus]\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\nAll the time69EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
