I swear I've seen your face before (Before, yeah)\nHope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more\nBaby, tell me what's your story?\nI ain't shy and don't you worry\nI'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight\nDo you come here much?\nI gotta see your face some more\nSome more, 'cause baby...\n[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]\nI'll never be the same - if we ever meet again\nWon't let you get away - say if we ever meet again\nThis free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)\nKiss me all night, don't ever let me go\nI'll never be the same - if we ever meet again\n\n[Bridge: Katy Perry & (Timbaland)]\nIf we ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say\n(If we ever meet again)\nIf we ever meet again, I won't let you go away\n(If we ever meet again)\nIf we ever, ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say\n(If we ever meet again)\nIf we ever, ever meet again, I won't let you go away\nAway-ay-ay-ay\n\n[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]\nI'll never be the same - if we ever meet again\nWon't let you get away - say if we ever meet again\nThis free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)\nKiss me all night, don't ever let me go\nI'll never be the same - if we ever meet again\nI'll never be the same - if we ever meet again\nWon't let you get away - say if we ever meet again\nThis free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)\nKiss me all night, don't ever let me go\nI'll never be the same - if we ever meet again\n[Outro: Sebastian]\nJust when the night can't get no less\nPorn star startin', what is this?\nVixens fightin' for their stress\nI put in like Mr. West, yes\nYou gon' finish dear\nAnd your body's so superb\nMe and you the best in here\nBut yo' girl, face and ear\nFace and ear, face and ear\nFace and ear, face and ear1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
