 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nOoooh, New York\nOoooh, New York\n\n[Verse 1]\nGrew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes\nNoise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean\nIf I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say\nSeein' my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway\n\n[Hook 1]\nEven if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams\nBaby, I'm from New York\nConcrete jungle where dreams are made of\nThere's nothin' you can't do\nNow you're in New York\nThese streets will make you feel brand-new\nBig lights will inspire you\nHear it for New York, New York, New York\n\n[Verse 2]\nOn the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard\nSuch a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God\nHail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge\nSomeone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge\n[Hook 2]\nI'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams\nBaby, I'm from New York\nConcrete jungle where dreams are made of\nThere's nothin' you can't do\nNow you're in New York\nThese streets will make you feel brand-new\nBig lights will inspire you\nHear it for New York, New York, New York\n\n[Bridge]\nOne hand in the air for the big city\nStreet lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty\nNo place in the world that can compare\nPut your lighters in the air, everybody say\n\"Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!\"\n\n[Hook 3]\nIn New York\nConcrete jungle where dreams are made of\nThere's nothin' you can't do\nNow you're in New York\nThese streets will make you feel brand-new\nBig lights will inspire you\nHear it for New York14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
