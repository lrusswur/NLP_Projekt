 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI always knew this day would come\nWe'd be standing one by one\nWith our future in our hands\nSo many dreams, so many plans\nI always knew after all these years\nThere'd be laughter, there'd be tears\nBut never thought that I'd walk away\nWith so much joy but so much pain\nAnd it's so hard to say goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nBut yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on\nI'm so thankful for the moments\nSo glad I got to know ya\nThe times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph\nAnd hold you in my heart forever\nI'll always remember you\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnother chapter in the book\nCan\u2019t go back, but you can look\nAnd there we are on every page\nMemories I'll always save\nUp ahead, only open doors\nWho knows what we're heading towards\nI wish you love, I wish you luck\nFor you, the world just opens up\nBut it's so hard to say goodbye\n[Chorus]\nYesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on\nI'm so thankful for the moments\nSo glad I got to know ya\nThe times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph\nAnd hold you in my heart forever\nI'll always remember you\n\n[Bridge]\nEvery day that we had, all the good, all the bad\nI'll keep them here inside\nAll the times that we shared, every place, everywhere\nYou touched my life\nYeah, one day we'll look back, we'll smile, and we'll laugh\nBut right now we just cry\n'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nYesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on\nI'm so thankful for the moments\nSo glad I got to know ya\nThe times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph\nAnd hold you in my heart forever\nI'll always remember you\nI'll always remember you\nI'll always remember you5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
