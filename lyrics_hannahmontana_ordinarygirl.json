 "lyrics": "[Intro]\nOh oh, yeah, hmm\nLa, da, da, da\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon't get me wrong, I love who I am\nI don't wanna be ungrateful\nIt probably sounds strange\nI really love the role I play, the songs I sing\nBut with all the fame\nThe things that seemed so simple\nAre suddenly so far out of reach\nI wish that they could see that underneath\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just an ordinary girl\nSometimes I'm lazy, I get bored\nI get scared, I feel ignored\nI feel happy, I get silly\nI choke on my own words\nI make wishes, I have dreams\nAnd I still want to believe\nAnything can happen in this world\nFor an ordinary girl\nLike you, like me\nFor an ordinary girl\nLike you, like me\n[Verse 2]\nHow are you?\nHello, goodbye\nOne day here, one day there\nAnd again it's time to go\nMiss Popular, always on the road\nPut my best foot forward\nGotta get on with the show\nStrike a pose for the front cover of a magazine\nEverywhere I arrive, I get high-fives\nThey paint me larger than life (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just an ordinary girl\nSometimes I'm lazy, I get bored\nI get scared, I feel ignored (Yeah)\nI feel happy, I get silly\nI choke on my own words\nI make wishes, I have dreams\nAnd I still want to believe\nAnything can happen in this world\nFor an ordinary girl\n\n[Bridge]\nSo give it everything or nothing at all\nAnd get back on your feet\nWhen you stumble and fall\nA little luck can go a long way\nSo don't you worry about what people say\nWho knows when the wind may blow\nFor an ordinary girl, hmm\n[Chorus]\nI'm just an ordinary girl\nSometimes I'm lazy, I get bored\nI get scared, I feel ignored\nI feel happy, I get silly\nI choke on my own words\nI make wishes, I have dreams\nAnd I still want to believe\nAnything can happen in this world\nFor an ordinary girl\nLike you, like me, yeah\nFor an ordinary girl\nLike you, like me\n\n[Outro]\nFor an ordinary girl\nMmm, for an ordinary girl\nLike me, like you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
