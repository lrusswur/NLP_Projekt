 "lyrics": "[Verse 1: John Mayer]\nI was born in the arms of imaginary friends\nFree to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been\nThen you come crashing in, like the realest thing\nTrying my best to understand all that your love can bring\n\n[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]\nOh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation\nHalf of my heart takes time\nHalf of my heart's got a right mind to tell you\nThat I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)\nOh, with half of my heart\n\n[Verse 2: John Mayer]\nI was made to believe I'd never love somebody else\nMade a plan, stay the man who can only love himself\nLonely was the song I sang, until the day you came\nShowing me another way and all that my love can bring\n\n[Chorus 1: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]\nOh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation\nHalf of my heart takes time\nHalf of my heart's got a right mind to tell you\nThat I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)\nOh, with half of my heart\n[Verse 3: John Mayer]\nYour faith is strong\nBut I can only fall short for so long\nDown the road, later on\nYou will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart\nBut I can't stop loving you\n\n[Backup Vocals: Taylor Swift]\nI can't stop loving you\n\nBut I can't stop loving you with half of my\nHalf of my heart\nHalf of my heart\n\n[Chorus 2: John Mayer & Taylor Swift]\nHalf of my heart\u2019s got a real cool imagination\nHalf of my heart\u2019s got you\nHalf of my heart\u2019s got the right mind to tell you\nHalf of my heart won\u2019t do\n\n[Outro: John Mayer ]\nHalf of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring\nAnd half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything\nHalf of my heart\nHalf of my heart\nHalf of my heart\nHalf of my heart\nHalf of my heart\nHalf of my heart6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
