 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDo you ever feel like a plastic bag\nDrifting through the wind, wanting to start again?\nDo you ever feel, feel so paper-thin\nLike a house of cards, one blow from caving in?\nDo you ever feel already buried deep?\nSix feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing\nDo you know that there's still a chance for you?\n'Cause there's a spark in you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou just gotta ignite the light\nAnd let it shine\nJust own the night\nLike the Fourth of July\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause baby, you're a firework\nCome on show 'em what you're worth\nMake 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\"\nAs you shoot across the sky\nBaby, you're a firework\nCome on, let your colors burst\nMake 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\"\nYou're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe\n[Verse 2]\nYou don't have to feel like a waste of space\nYou're original, cannot be replaced\nIf you only knew what the future holds\nAfter a hurricane comes a rainbow\nMaybe a reason why all the doors are closed\nSo you could open one that leads you to the perfect road\nLike a lightning bolt, your heart will glow\nAnd when it's time, you'll know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou just gotta ignite the light\nAnd let it shine\nJust own the night\nLike the Fourth of July\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause baby, you're a firework\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth\nMake 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\"\nAs you shoot across the sky\nBaby, you're a firework\nCome on, let your colors burst\nMake 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\"\nYou're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe\n[Bridge]\nBoom, boom, boom\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon\nIt's always been inside of you, you, you\nAnd now it's time to let it through\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause baby, you're a firework\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth\nMake 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\"\nAs you shoot across the sky\nBaby, you're a firework\nCome on, let your colors burst\nMake 'em go, \"Aah, aah, aah\"\nYou're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe\n\n[Outro]\nBoom, boom, boom\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon\nBoom, boom, boom\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon83EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
