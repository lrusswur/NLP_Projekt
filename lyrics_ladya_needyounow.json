 "lyrics": "[Intro: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]\n\"Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep\"\n\"Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight and I don't know. I just miss you so much\nGive me a call back if you can?\"\n\n[Verse 1: Hillary Scott]\nPicture perfect memories\nScattered all around the floor\nReachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]\nAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mind\nFor me, it happens all the time\n\n[Chorus: Lady A]\nIt's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now\nSaid I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now\nAnd I don't know how I can do without\nI just need you now\n\n[Verse 2: Charles Kelley]\nAnother shot of whiskey\nCan't stop lookin' at the door\nWishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lady A & Charles Kelley]\nAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mind\nFor me, it happens all the time\n[Chorus: Lady A]\nIt's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now\nSaid I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now\nAnd I don't know how I can do without\nI just need you now\nWhoa, oh\n\n[Bridge: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]\nI guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all\n\n[Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley & Lady A]\nIt's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now\nAnd I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now\nAnd I don't know how I can do without\nI just need you now\n\n[Outro: Lady A & Hillary Scott]\nI just need you now\nOh baby, I need you now38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
