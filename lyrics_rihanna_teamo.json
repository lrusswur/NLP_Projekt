 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTe amo, te amo\nShe says to me\nI hear the pain in her voice\nThen we danced underneath the candelabra\nShe takes the lead\nThat's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over\n\n[Chorus]\nThen she said te amo\nThen she put her hand around me waist\nI told her no\nShe cried te amo\nI told her I'm not gonna run away\nBut let me go\nMy soul is awry\nWithout asking why\nI said te amo\nWish somebody'd tell me what she said?\nDon't it mean I love you?\nThink it means I love you\nDon't it mean I love you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nTe amo, te amo\nShe's scared to breathe\nI hold her hand, I got no choice, uh\nPulled me out on the beach, danced in the water\nI start to leave\nShe's begging me and asking why it's over\n[Chorus]\nThen she said te amo\nThen she put her hand around me waist\nI told her no\nShe cried te amo\nI told her I'm not gonna run away\nBut let me go\nMy soul is awry\nWithout asking why\nI said te amo\nWish somebody'd tell me what she said?\nDon't it mean I love you?\nThink it means I love you\nDon't it mean I love you?\n\n[Bridge]\nListen, we can dance\nBut you gotta watch your hands\nWatch me all night\nI\u2019m moving through the light\nBecause I understand\nThat we all need love\nAnd I'm not afraid\nTo feel the love, but I don't feel that way\n\n[Chorus]\nThen she said te amo\nThen she put her hand around me waist\nI told her no\nShe cried te amo\nI told her I'm not gonna run away\nBut let me go\nMy soul is awry\nWithout asking why\nI said te amo\nWish somebody'd tell me what she said?\nDon't it mean I love you?\nThink it means I love you\nDon't it mean I love you?\nThink it means I love you\n[Outro]\nTe amo, te amo\nDon't it mean I love you?19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
