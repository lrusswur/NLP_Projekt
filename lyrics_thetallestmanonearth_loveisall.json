 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell I walk upon the river like it's easier than land\nEvil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand\nOh, your will is in my hand\nAnd I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still\nLove is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill\nOh, mine has learned to kill\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I said I could rise\nFrom the harness of our goals\nHere come the tears\nBut like always, I let them go\nJust let them go\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor\nThe future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore\nNo, we don't dream anymore\n\nLike a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in\nI bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin\nOh, my savior and my sin\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I said I could rise\nFrom the harness of our goals\nHere come the tears\nBut like always, I let them go\nJust let them go\n[Verse 3]\nWell I walk upon the river like it's easier than land\nEvil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand\nYour strength is in my hand\n\nAnd I'll throw you in the current that I stand upon so still\nLove is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill\nOh, mine has learned to kill\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I said I could rise\nFrom the harness of our goals\nHere come the tears\nBut like always, I let them go\nJust let them go7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
