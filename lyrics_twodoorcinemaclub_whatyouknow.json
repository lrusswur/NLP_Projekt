 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn a few weeks, I will get time\nTo realise it's right before my eyes\nAnd I can take it if it's what I want to do\nI am leaving and this is starting\nTo feel like it's right before my eyes\nAnd I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can tell just what you want\nYou don't want to be alone\nYou don't want to be alone\nAnd I can't say it's what you know\nBut you've known it the whole time\nYeah, you've known it the whole time\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe next year, I'll have no time\nTo think about the questions to address\nAm I the one to try to stop the fire?\nI wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you\nCould have obtained, why try anything?\nI will get there; just remember, I know\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can tell just what you want\nYou don't want to be alone\nYou don't want to be alone\nAnd I can't say it's what you know\nBut you've known it the whole time\nYeah, you've known it the whole time\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can tell just what you want\nYou don't want to be alone\nYou don't want to be alone\nAnd I can't say it's what you know\nBut you've known it the whole time\nYeah, you've known it the whole time52EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
