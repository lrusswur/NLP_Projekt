 "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou had it all\nThe day you told me, told me you want me\nI had it all\nBut let you fool me, fool me completely\nYeah, I was so stupid to give you all my attention\n'Cause the way you played me\nExposed your true intentions\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd one day\nI'll have you beggin' on your knees for me\nYeah, one day\nI'll have you crawling like a centipede\nYou messed with me and messed with her\nSo I'll make sure you get what you deserve\nYeah, one day\nYou'll be beggin' on your knees for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo watch your back\n'Cause you don't know when or where I could get you\nI've set the trap\nAnd when I'm done, then you'll know what I've been through\nSo, oh, Mr. Player\nDo you feel like the man now?\nAnd I bet you're nervous\n'Cause this song makes you freak out\n[Chorus]\nAnd one day\nI'll have you beggin' on your knees for me\nYeah, one day\nI'll have you crawling like a centipede\nYou messed with me and messed with her\nSo I'll make sure you get what you deserve\nYeah, one day\nYou'll be beggin' on your knees for me\n\n[Bridge]\nI know I'm being bitter\nBut I'ma drag you under\n'Cause you just don't, don't deserve happy ever after\nFor what you did to me\nAfter you told me you never felt that way\nIt was only just a game\nYou had it all\nAnd one day\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd one day\nI'll have you beggin' on your knees for me\nYeah, one day\nI'll have you crawling like a centipede\nYou messed with me and messed with her\nSo I'll make sure you get what you deserve\nYeah, one day\nYou'll be beggin' on your knees for me7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
